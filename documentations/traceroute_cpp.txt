                               Traceroute Porting to C++

1. Introduction
This is an exercise attempting to port Traceroute source code from 
Tracereoute.sourceforge.net to C++.

A couple of challenges arrose in the effort. one was to comprehend
the large set of command line arguments which may be utilized to customize the
traceroute operation. Traceroute allows the user to select the protocol,( i.e.
UDP, TCP, UDPLite, ICMP DCCP), the socket type (i.e. SOCK_RAW, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_STREAM),
port/sequence numbers (if applicable), IP/TCP header field configurations, payload size,
probe pattern, and result rendering.

The other one is dealing with a variety of BSD Socket APIs to retrieve a network host 
info, create the socket, set/get socket options, parameters. 

The work remains in progress. currently TCP on raw socket is working. UDP/UDP lite 
code is in place and yet to do further debugging.
