using selection sorting; that is to pick a pivot element and move all the elements less than the pivot element
  value to the left side and the bigger ones to its right. if the pivot element happens to be the kth , return;
case 2:  the k is less than i + 1; continue the procecure with the first half.
case 3: continue with the second half, adjust k to k - i - 1;    
complexity: best case O(1); worst case O(n*n). average O(n)
