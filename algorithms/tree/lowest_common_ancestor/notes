The approach is to check first if the two nodes belong to two children trees.
if return yes, the current node is the lowerest ancestor
if belong to the same subtree, then assignn the child node as current node  iand continue
 corner cases:
   1. either of the two nodes are NULL, return NULL
   2. one node is the current node, and the other is in one of the subtrees, return the current node
 
complexity:
    in average/worst case, O(N)
